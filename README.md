# A simulation of the double pendulum chaotic motion using Python.

## Introduction
The simple pendulum has an apparent simple motion, and yet, the union of two pendulums generate a system with a chaotic motion. Although there is no formal proof, there is no known solution for the double pendulum system motion, and thus, it must be solved numerically. This study aims to analyze such a system and compare the sensitivity to different numerical methods. Moreover, it is also a goal to goal to analyze how the chaotic motion takes place, and whether it is prevalent for the entire system or for some cases.
To achieve that, equations of motion are obtained using the Euler-Lagrangian equation. The resulting differential equations are them solved numerically, using Runge-Kutta (4th order) and Euler’s Explicit Forward methods. The system is then computationally simulated using the programming language python. Detailed solutions are initially presented for different initial states of the system and the two different numerical methods, analyzing motion, behavior, and mechanical energy of the system. Then, solutions are presented for a very large number of initial positions, allowing for patterns to be discovered.

This repository contains the modelling of the equations of motion, and numerical solution (Implementaiton of the numerical methods). All models used and references can be found on the report and on the [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements) and [Bibliography](#Bibliography) sections.

## Installation
All necessary libraries are shown in the beginning of each notebook. The code was tested with [Python 3.9.7 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/), but should work with version 3.x. 

The recommended way to install the libraries is with [Pypi](https://pypi.org), using pip:
```bash
> pip install <libraryname>
```
Before opening an issue, make sure your libraries are updated:
```bash
> pip install --upgrade <libraryname>
```

## Usage
Either: 

* Clone the repository, which will give you all the data used in the original study. Please see [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements) for licensing of each data source information.

* Use the notebooks, which will download and process all the data, and is throughout commented to allow for some flexibility in the simulation.

* It should be noted that the execution time rises exponentially for a large number of points. For example, simulating 1500 initial angular positions for each pendulum bob generates a total of 2,250,000 trajectories, which took approximately 16h of continuous running in the author's machine. A suggestion to improve that is to either parallelize the code or use an implementation such as [Cython](https://cython.org/)
